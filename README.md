# Canela

This is a simple Cinnamon theme, it includes only the theme for Cinnamon.

This represents my vision of how to modernize the default Cinnamon theme (what was used to create this), after I saw the post in Linux Mint about modernizing the default theme.

It still have a few more things to adjust, but it's mostly done.

Soon I'll place some screenshots here.
